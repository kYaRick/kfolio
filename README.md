> **Disclaimer:** This is my first-ever adventure into the wild world of Blazor. 

It's where I'm trying to craft something actually beautiful and productive - while religiously applying every "creative architectural decision" (read: artistic crutch) in my arsenal. This project serves as my personal sandbox: a place to practice the fine art of over-engineering the simple and elegantly hacking the complex. 

Think of it as a living demonstration of .NET 10 possibilities and a practical proof that if you throw enough Glassmorphism at a page, it starts looking like you know what you're doing. 

No legacy code here - only fresh, organic, artisanal bugs. This is a chill, lampy zone for visual and technical experiments.
